// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps
To test your pipeline, do the following:

. Make a code change to your configured source repository, commit, and push the change.
. Open the CodePipeline console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/.
. Choose your pipeline from the list.
. Watch the pipeline progress through its stages. Your pipeline should complete and your Amazon ECS service runs the Docker image that was created from your code change.
. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS console^].
. Navigate to the Amazon ECS task updated by the pipeline and expand the container details.
. Open the URL for the application. Confirm that your application sample is deployed.
